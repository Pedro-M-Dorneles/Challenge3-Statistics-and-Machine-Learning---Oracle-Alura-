# 🤖 Customer Churn Prediction – Telecom X

This project is part of the second phase of the **Telecom X** challenge, focusing on building a predictive model to anticipate customer churn. Using supervised machine learning techniques, the objective is to identify which customers are most likely to cancel their services, allowing for strategic retention actions.

## 🔍 About the Project

After completing the exploratory data analysis, this second part of the project focuses on:

- Building a complete machine learning pipeline
- Handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling
- Applying class balancing techniques (SMOTE)
- Training and tuning classification models (KNN and Random Forest)
- Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 Score
- Analyzing feature importance to understand key churn drivers
